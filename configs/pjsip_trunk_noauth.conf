;===============ENDPOINT CONFIGURED AS A TRUNK, OUTBOUND AUTHENTICATION=======
;
; This is one way to configure an endpoint as a trunk. It is set up with
; "outbound_auth=" to enable authentication when dialing out through this
; endpoint. There is no inbound authentication set up since a provider will
; not normally authenticate when calling you.
;
; The identify configuration enables IP address matching against this endpoint.
; For calls from a trunking provider, the From user may be different every time,
; so we want to match against IP address instead of From user.
;
; If you want the provider of your trunk to know where to send your calls
; you'll need to use an outbound registration as in the example above this
; section.
;
; NAT
;
; At a basic level configure the endpoint with a transport that is set up
; with the appropriate NAT settings. There may be some additional settings you
; need here based on your NAT/Firewall scenario. Look to the CLI config help
; "config show help res_pjsip endpoint" or on the wiki for other NAT related
; options and configuration. We've included a few below.
;
; AOR
;
; Endpoints use one or more AOR sections to store their contact details.
; You can define multiple contact addresses in SIP URI format in multiple
; "contact=" entries.
