;===============OUTBOUND REGISTRATION WITH OUTBOUND AUTHENTICATION============
;
; This is a simple registration that works with some SIP trunking providers.
; You'll need to set up the auth example "mytrunk_auth" below to enable outbound
; authentication. Note that we "outbound_auth=" use for outbound authentication
; instead of "auth=", which is for inbound authentication.
;
; If you are registering to a server from behind NAT, be sure you assign a transport
; that is appropriately configured with NAT related settings. See the NAT transport example.
;
; "contact_user=" sets the SIP contact header's user portion of the SIP URI
; this will affect the extension reached in dialplan when the far end calls you at this
; registration. The default is 's'.
;
; If you would like to enable line support and have incoming calls related to this
; registration go to an endpoint automatically the "line" and "endpoint" options must
; be set. The "endpoint" option specifies what endpoint the incoming call should be
; associated with.

;===============ENDPOINT CONFIGURED AS A TRUNK, OUTBOUND AUTHENTICATION=======
;
; This is one way to configure an endpoint as a trunk. It is set up with
; "outbound_auth=" to enable authentication when dialing out through this
; endpoint. There is no inbound authentication set up since a provider will
; not normally authenticate when calling you.
;
; The identify configuration enables IP address matching against this endpoint.
; For calls from a trunking provider, the From user may be different every time,
; so we want to match against IP address instead of From user.
;
; If you want the provider of your trunk to know where to send your calls
; you'll need to use an outbound registration as in the example above this
; section.
;
; NAT
;
; At a basic level configure the endpoint with a transport that is set up
; with the appropriate NAT settings. There may be some additional settings you
; need here based on your NAT/Firewall scenario. Look to the CLI config help
; "config show help res_pjsip endpoint" or on the wiki for other NAT related
; options and configuration. We've included a few below.
;
; AOR
;
; Endpoints use one or more AOR sections to store their contact details.
; You can define multiple contact addresses in SIP URI format in multiple
; "contact=" entries.
